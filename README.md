# Batch Ethereum transactions

Simple batch transaction builder to play around with [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702). Works in [supported wallets](https://7702beat.swiss-knife.xyz/) like Metamask, Uniswap Wallet and others.

It's intentionally low level, but the "generate calldata" button makes it easier to do basic things like transfer a bunch of tokens in a single transaction.

I recommend using [Ethereum Dev Tools MCP](https://github.com/gskril/ethereum-mcp) to generate calldata for your transactions.
